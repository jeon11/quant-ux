    "## Project 1b: GoogleSheets API and Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "I use a survey data collected from one of my previous projects in user research. In this project, I work with GoogleSheets API through the Google Clouds. The process requires establishing keys and credentials so the. Below, I write the quick process of setting it up and walk through reading in the sheets and analyze data from the survey responses collected from Google Form. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why I chose this project: \n",
    "\n",
    "As UX researchers, survey studies are essential for understanding the users. Because it can be quickly developed and sent out to (usually) receive a good amount of sample in a short period of time, I use surveys to conduct initial research to understand the general problem space and behaviors. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the free and efficient tools is the Google Forms. If there was a Python code to directly work and manipulate data collected from the Forms on the fly as the data streams in, it would cut out the additional step of having to download each file. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data analysis of data from Google Form is particular of interest because while it generates pie graphs and bar graphs to summarize the survey results, the results are often too rudimentary or basic. Using Python, we can easily handle large sets of data and breakdown the data by each demographic.\n"
