    "#### Using Google Cloud Platform and its API : \n",
    "**Google Cloud Platform** is a suite of cloud computing services that lets developers interact with APIs that involve data storage, data analytics, and machine learning. In this notebook, I use GoogleSheets API to directly read in sheets from the drive. Besides reading in the sheets, the API allows you to create, manipulate, filter, and organize metadata. \n",
    "\n",
    "With GoogleSheets API, I study survey data collected from my previous projects in user research. The process involves establishing credentials and keys so the program knows to use my credentials to access the private files. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goal of this notebook: \n",
    "\n",
    "Survey studies are essential for understanding the users because they can be quickly developed and sent out to receive a good amount of sample in a short period of time. Surveys are powerful to be utilized for conducting initial research at a discovery stage to explore the general problem space and user behaviors. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the free and efficient tools is the Google Forms. With GoogleSheets API, we are able to access and manipulate incoming or completed data through code. Furthermore, we can easily shape and analyze data through Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "While Google Form is capable of generating pie graphs and bar graphs to summarize the survey results, the visualizations are often rudimentary or basic. Using Python, we can easily handle large sets of data and breakdown and analyze the data by each demographic group, and probe for any interesting results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specifically, let's see if there are any significant differences or responses that are made for each age group and gender.**"

    "## Setting up Google Sheets API\n",
    "\n",
    "The high level process of setting up Google API is as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Create an Oauth credential** (Instruction link: https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Pip install the required packages** \n",
    "\n",
    "> ` pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib` \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Set scope and spreadsheet ID**\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Auth scopes** set the permissions that your code requests to authorize for the app\n",
    "For example, scope code of:\n",
    "    - **.readonly** allows to read all resources and the meta data but with no writing operations\n",
    "    - **.label** lets you create, read, update, and delete labels. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spreadsheet ID** is the parameter that gets used to tell which spreadsheet to access. The ID is called from a part of the full URL."
